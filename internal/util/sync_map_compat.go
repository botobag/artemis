// SyncMap is like a Go map[interface{}]interface{} but is safe for concurrent use
// by multiple goroutines without additional locking or coordination.
// Loads, stores, and deletes run in amortized constant time.
//
// The SyncMap type is specialized. Most code should use a plain Go map instead,
// with separate locking or coordination, for better type safety and to make it
// easier to maintain other invariants along with the map content.
//
// The SyncMap type is optimized for two common use cases: (1) when the entry for a given
// key is only ever written once but read many times, as in caches that only grow,
// or (2) when multiple goroutines read, write, and overwrite entries for disjoint
// sets of keys. In these two cases, use of a SyncMap may significantly reduce lock
// contention compared to a Go map paired with a separate Mutex or RWMutex.
//
// The zero SyncMap is empty and ready for use. A SyncMap must not be copied after first use.

	// The read field itself is always safe to load, but must only be stored with
	// mu held.
	//
	// Entries stored in read may be updated concurrently without mu, but updating
	// a previously-expunged entry requires that the entry be copied to the dirty
	// map and unexpunged with mu held.
	read atomic.Value // readOnly

	// dirty contains the portion of the map's contents that require mu to be
	// held. To ensure that the dirty map can be promoted to the read map quickly,
	// it also includes all of the non-expunged entries in the read map.
	//
	// Expunged entries are not stored in the dirty map. An expunged entry in the
	// clean map must be unexpunged and added to the dirty map before a new value
	// can be stored to it.

	// making a shallow copy of the clean map, omitting stale entries.

	// needed to lock mu to determine whether the key was present.
