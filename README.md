Artemis is an implementation of GraphQL for Go. If you're working on GraphQL, you probably heard [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/) which provides great infrasture and tooling to develop a GraphQL service. While Apollo Platform stack is built on top of Node.js, we aim to build one in Go. If you happen to know a bit about [Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis), you should have guessed how the project got its name.

The project goal of Artemis is to provide a GraphQL implementation and to integrate features that are essential to build production GraphQL services, all developed in Go. The following highlight some of its focuses:

- **Beyond feature-complete**: We'll not only try to catch up [latest GraphQL specification](https://facebook.github.io/graphql/draft/) but also the experimental features that are already in [`graphql-js`](https://github.com/graphql-go/graphql).
- **Driven by community**: The development and design is driven by the needs of developers. Issues should be responded in short time. PRs welcome!
